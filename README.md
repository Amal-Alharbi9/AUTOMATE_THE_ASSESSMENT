# AUTOMATE_THE_ASSESSMENT
AUTOMATE THE ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT RESULTS PROCESS


I worked to automate a kind of education manual process using popular RPA software like #Uipath :
The teacher collects the grades of the students and evaluates them based on their skills during the semester.


## Benefits of automating this process:

 1- Teacher can concentrate on devoting their valuable time to perform more productive and strategic tasks.

 2- Enable minimum errors.

 3- Saving teachers' time.


## One of the pictures shows the As Is process (manual process before the automated) and the other shows the To Be process (process after the automated)
